      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the official website of Rick Sanchez, the interdimensional genius scientist! With an unparalleled intellect, groundbreaking inventions, and a dash of irreverence, I am at the forefront of scientific exploration.</p>
      <p>I have revolutionized interdimensional travel with my iconic portal gun and state-of-the-art spaceship. My contributions span genetic engineering, quantum physics, and more. No problem is too big or bizarre for me to tackle.</p>
      <p>But it's not just about science—it's about my unique perspective and unrivaled wit. I bring sarcasm, nihilism, and dark humor to every project. Science can be fun, exciting, and a little dangerous.</p>
      <p>Explore this website to discover my latest inventions, incredible adventures, and the mysteries of the multiverse. Buckle up, and remember—science is only limited by your imagination!</p>
